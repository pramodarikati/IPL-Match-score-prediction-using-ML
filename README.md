# IPL-Match-score-prediction-using-ML


Indian Premier League (IPL) is an expert cricket class dependent on Twenty20 arrangement and is 
represented by the Board of Control for Cricket in India. The class happens each year with taking part
groups' names addressing different urban communities of India. There are numerous nations dynamic
in getting sorted out Twenty20 cricket leagues. 

# Models

Logistic Regression: Logistic relapse utilizes a condition on the grounds that the portrayal, extensively like 
rectilinear regression.Information regards (x) are joined straightly utilizing loads or coefficient
esteems (alluded to in light of the fact that the Athens letter Beta) to foresee a yield esteem (y).A key
difference from rectilinear regression is that the output value being modeled may be a binary values instead of a numeric value.

Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest is an ensemble technique that is used to perform regression
and classification tasks. Ensemble techniques combine results of various machine learning models and
give the best accurate prediction of any individual model.

# DESIGNING THE DATASET

The main source of past matches data is the official website of Indian Premier League. The data is
scrapped from this official site and stored in a Comma Separated Values (CSV).

# RESULTS

We used different machine learning algorithms to find the best combination that gives
the most accuracy. We used five ML calculations: Decision Trees, Random Forest

Random Forest Accuracy: The accuracy of the Random Forest classifier is 88.24 %, while that of
SVM is 87.38%The accuracy of the Random Forest classifier is 88.24%, while that of SVM is 87.38 %,
thus we chose Random Forest classifier as our preferred classifier. The dataset contains 20 percent
testing set and 80 percent training set.

# Deploy the model

When fixing a web webpage you'll
generally have your live site, which is named the live environment or creation environment.
